Public Version of Cornell ClassRoster Bot

Cornell ClassRoster Bot is a Discord bot that returns class info, links to reviews and discussions of the class, as well as other helpful info as a Discord message. It takes data from Cornell ClassRoster, CUReviews, and Reddit. 

This repository is the public version with the Token edited out.

Also included are Procfile and requirements.txt, because this bot is deployed on Heroku. Otherwise, these files are not necessary.

TODO list:
- integrate with median grades masterlist
- integrate with RateMyProfessors
